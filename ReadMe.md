- You can set the "isval" flag to 1 for cross-validation on the training set (e.g. to optimize parameters with your preference using different preprocessing options and a new set of hyper-parameters)
- for cross-validating or testing other dimensions modify "targetID"  (1 for age group, 2 for gender classification)  
- The classifier folder contains function implementions for classifiers and utility folder contains utility functions.
